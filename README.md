*1.Use labelme to generate a JSON file, and then create a JSON file_ to_ Batch conversion of dataset.py to label
*2.Based on the training of biosenet based on tensorflow, the weight obtained. Single picture predicted
*3.Using OpenCV to make a single picture into a video effect
*4.Using OpenCV to design anti-collision algorithm
